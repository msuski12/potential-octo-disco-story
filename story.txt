Once upon a time, in Madison, WI, there lived a girl, eighteen years old, living on her own for the first time in the mythical land of "Lakeshore." Her name was Sarah.  Sarah attended the University of Wisconsin, studying Psychology.  Now, Sarah was on her own when it came to paying for school, and in order to make end's meet, she held a job working long nights as a waitress.  Her hours were long and taxing, leaving her exhausted each an every night.  One day while walking to class, Sarah noticed a flyer for a new Psychology study asking for freshman participants.  It advertised a payout of $200 for one weekend of observation.  Sarah knew this would help ease her financial worries, and eagerly booked a slot in the study.  What it entailed, however, was shocking...
When she woke up, she found that she was locked in a small room, very similar to the room that she has seen in the DIsney movie. She found there is a binder on the table. There is a sheet of paper inside." Welcome to the world of miracle. In the world, all the things are opposite to the real world." After she finished reading the paper, she was very excited. However, she did not she was being observed by the experimenter.
She was very confused. She didn't know that the experiment would be this weird and she found the nearest door but it was locked! She was trapped like a mouse in a trap. She was really hungry and she didn't know what to do.
She tried to hit the door with her body but passed directly through the door.  The room just was projected by a virtual-reality device. There was a wide street in front of Sarah and there was a lot of Tyrannosaurus walking on it! Sarah found a tyrannosaurus who is with a mobile phone and wearing a human nude photo t-shirt. He was scared by Sarah, and the phone fell off from his short arm. He widened his eyes and shouted, "A human!"
